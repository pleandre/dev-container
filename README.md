A comprehensive, multi-language development environment in a container, featuring code-server, JupyterLab, and a suite of development tools.  

## Quick Start with docker-compose
To get started quickly, you can use `docker-compose` to run the container. First, create a `data` directory with the following subdirectories to persist your configuration and extensions:
- `.config`
- `extensions`

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  coder:
    image: pleandre/dev-container
    container_name: coder
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Port exposed by Code Server
      - "3000:3000"  # Port for web apps like React with auto-reload
      - "81:81"      # Port for Nginx / PHP
      - "80:80"      # Port for APIs
      - "8888:8888"  # Port for Jupyter
#    volumes:
#      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"  # Optional, Socket for Docker, if you want to have access to your host docker within the dev container
#      - "./settings/code-server-vscode-marketplace.json:/opt/dev-container/code-server/marketplace.json" # Optional, code server extension market place settings
#      - "./settings/extensions.json:/opt/dev-container/code-server/extensions.json" # Optional, to install extensions at startup
#      - "./www:/usr/share/nginx/www" # Optional, php server root directory
#      - "./projects:/home/dev-user/projects/" # Optional, projects directory
#      - "./jupyter:/home/dev-user/jupyter/" # Optional, jupyter directory
```  

You can also mount your Git repository or other folders.  
  
If you don't need any persistence or don't need to run Docker inside Docker, or to test the container, you can run the following command:  
```bash
docker run -d --name dev-container -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 -p 81:81 -p 80:80 -p 8888:8888 pleandre/dev-container
```  
Make sure to change the ports and volume paths according to your needs. The `docker run` command is provided for a quick start without persistent storage.

## Versions Auto-Updates

Our project prioritizes keeping dependencies current through an automated update mechanism that runs daily. This ensures that our development environment is consistently aligned with the newest versions of tools and libraries. The process is orchestrated by a GitHub Actions workflow, complemented by a Python script:  
- [update-versions.yml](./.github/workflows/update-versions.yml) - A GitHub Actions workflow that initiates the version update routine.
- [update-versions.py](./.github/workflows/update-versions.py) - The script responsible for executing the version updates.

Additionally, we maintain the robustness of our environment with automated testing:  
- [test.yml](./.github/workflows/test.yml) -  This GitHub Action is triggered on every pull request to run our suite of tests.
- [run-tests.sh](./tests/run-tests.sh) - A script that automates the testing process, ensuring all components are correctly installed and configured.

Our objective is to provide a development environment that's always equipped with the latest tooling.  
This approach is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart new projects in any of the supported languages, with the confidence that they're working with the most up-to-date versions available.  

## Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions to the dev-container! Your insights and improvements help us build a more robust and versatile development environment.  
Hereâ€™s how you could contribute:
